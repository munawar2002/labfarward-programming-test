defined at /test/resources/features/**

###  Swagger Codegen
Swagger Codegen can simplify your build process by generating server stubs and client SDKs for any API, defined with the
 OpenAPI (formerly known as Swagger) specification, so your team can focus better on your APIâ€™s implementation and adoption.

To create a new API, define your api definition in "/main/resources/api-swagger.yml" and compile your code. 

### API Documentation
Run the springboot application by running ProgrammingtestApplication.java Or from run maven command mvnw

Make sure you have provided your mysql databse username and passeord in application.yml file.

After deploying the application, the documentation can be accessed through url
